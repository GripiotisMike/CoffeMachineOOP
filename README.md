# Coffee Machine with OOP

- This Project let me understand better the uses of Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

- I also learned how to construct Objects and access their Attributes and Methods.

- You can compare this one with my previous repository named CoffeMachine (https://github.com/GripiotisMike/CoffeMachine)
